First, put 1/4 cups choco chips and 1/4 cup butter in a mug and microwave it for a minute.

Second, mix it nicely so it forms a chocolate syrup.

Then, add 1/4 cup plain flour, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 cup milk.

Stir nicely, so it forms a think chocolate paste.

Now, pour the paste into a greased ramekin.

Put the ramekin into the oven for 15 minutes at 180 C.

After that's done, enjoy your lava cake!!
